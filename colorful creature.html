        <h1>The Coolest creature</h1>
        
        <p>
            The <em>Dove,</em><strong>Doves are gentle birds,</strong><br>
            and will not bite or attack the way some parrot species will.<br>
            Ring-necked doves can be easily hand-tamed,<br>
            though most owners do not interact with them in this way.<br>
            These birds love to be in pairs, and will breed easily.
        </p>
